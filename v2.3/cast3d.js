// THE CAST IN THREE DIMENSIONS
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A painted sprite can only face one way. Every hero on this stage has been a
// single .webp since Build 4, which is why they turn to face the camera when
// they cross the board, why a strike is a CSS nudge rather than a swing, and
// why the all-out is four sprites sliding at a fifth. The figures are the one
// part of the fight that cannot act.
//
// THIS LAYER DOES NOT REPLACE THE STAGE. That is the whole design. The DOM
// keeps every job it already does — .k-hero holds the box, the row, the drag,
// the aim target, the popups, the shadow, the drop zones, the party HUD. This
// draws ONE canvas across #k-cast, reads where the DOM has put each hero this
// frame, and paints a figure into that box. Nothing above it knows the
// difference; the img inside .k-fig is simply hidden.
//
// It follows that a CSS transform on .k-hero — the walk between rows, the
// drag, the forward lean on a play — moves the 3D figure too, for free and in
// perfect sync, because the figure's position IS the element's box read fresh
// every frame. There is no second copy of the layout to keep true.
//
// OFF BY DEFAULT. `?cast=3d` turns it on. The eight suites run the 2D stage
// exactly as before.
//
// BUILD 114: the three of them are their OWN models now, generated from the
// concept art that has been on the cards since Build 4, and they move with
// motion-captured clips instead of the eight hand-written poses that stood in
// for them. Ash keeps his sword, Elin keeps her staff. What made that
// affordable is that Meshy's humanoid auto-rig is standardised: all three came
// back with the same 24 joints, in the same order, under the same names, so
// the clip library is generated ONCE against one of them and retargets onto
// all three by name.

// ── who is on the board, and what colour they are ──────────────────────────
//
// THREE MODELS NOW, one per person, generated from the concept art that has
// been on their cards since Build 4. Build 112 ran one model in three palettes
// to find out whether the watercolour treatment could hold three separately
// generated figures together — it could, which is why this step was worth
// taking. What survives from that experiment is the palette itself.
//
// THEY FACE THE ENEMY, AND IT IS COMPUTED, NOT CHOSEN. Two builds got this
// wrong by eye — a generated model faces wherever the generator pointed it, a
// clip can carry its own turn, and a figure at three-quarters is genuinely
// hard to call from a 145-pixel render. So the layer MEASURES which way each
// body faces, from the line between its shoulders, and turns it to face the
// foe. `turn` is a fine adjustment ON TOP of that: three-quarters toward the
// camera, so they read as people rather than shoulders, and a few degrees
// apart so the line does not look stamped.
//
// THE HUE LIVES IN THE SHADOW, NOT IN THE PAPER. Tinting the light end is how
// three figures turn into three lumps of colour — cream, sage and gold — that
// read as silhouettes rather than as painted people. Real watercolour keeps
// the paper nearly white and does its colouring where the pigment pools, so
// each hero gets a near-neutral paper and a shadow that carries the character:
// warm earth for Ash, cold slate for Elin, sage for Mira.
//
// AND THE FOE IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THEM (Build 118). It stands in a
// different box, faces the other way and holds a different pose, but it is the
// same rig, the same retarget and the same clip library — which is the whole
// return on having done the retargeting properly. A new foe costs a model and
// no animation at all.

// `strike` and everything else is shared.
//
// The names on the right are the clips in the library, which are named for the

// so swapping a clip for a longer or shorter one changes nothing here.

// ── the animation ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// BUILD 112 WROTE THESE BY HAND. The sample model arrived with no animation —
// one 0.3s clip holding a single keyframe per channel — so its eight verbs
// were authored as bone-rotation data: readable, tiny, and unmistakably
// hand-keyed. They are gone now, and so is the STANCE correction that existed
// only because those poses were offsets from a T-pose.
//
// What replaced them is a library of ten real clips, milled out of Meshy's
// animation catalogue by v2.3/tools/clips.cjs and stored as
// THREE.AnimationClip JSON. `Combat_Stance` for the idle, `Sword_Judgment`
// for Ash, `Double_Combo_Attack` for Mira, `Attack` for Elin's staff,
// `Charged_Spell_Cast`, `mage_soell_cast` for mending, `Block1`,
// `Sword_Parry`, `Hit_Reaction`, `Knock_Down`.
//
// Ten clips arrived as ten ~6 MB GLBs, each carrying a whole character around
// the curves we actually wanted. Stripped of mesh and texture, and of the
// scale tracks a rig nothing scales does not need, the library is 685 KB.

// ── the watercolour material ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// PATCHED, NOT REPLACED. A raw ShaderMaterial has to re-implement skinning,
// and a version that silently does not renders the bind pose — which looks
// exactly like an art problem and is not one. Patching the stock material also
// keeps normals and the view vector in the SAME space (three gives both in
// view space); dotting a view-space normal against a world-space eye vector
// turns the whole figure black.
//
// Four moves, and the third is the one that actually reads as watercolour:
//   1. lift      — watercolour has no true black; the paper shows through
//   2. wash      — luminance quantised into three bands, so tone STEPS
//   3. edge dark — pigment pools where the water stops. A thin fresnel band
//                  toward ink. Without it this reads as flat 3D, not as paint.
//   4. grain     — the paper's tooth, in SCREEN space, so it stays paper and
//                  does not swim around with the figure

// EVERY MODEL COMES BACK ON ITS OWN SKELETON. Not "the same skeleton in a
// different pose" — a genuinely different bind pose per generation. Ash, Elin
// and Mira differ from each other by more than a radian at the wrist, and all
// three differ from the rig the clips were authored on. Same 24 names, same
// hierarchy, different rest orientations.
//
// Played raw that shears the mesh, because every joint is handed an absolute
// local rotation that meant one thing on the rig it was recorded from and
// something else on the rig it lands on.
//
// THIS IS A MODEL-SPACE OPERATION, and doing it in local space is the trap. A
// first attempt used `rest_t · rest_s⁻¹ · q` per bone, which is only exact
// when the two rigs' PARENTS already agree — it fixed Ash and Mira most of the
// way and left Elin, whose rest pose is furthest from the source, a collapsed
// bag of cloth. What is actually invariant between two skeletons is where a
// bone points IN THE WORLD relative to where it rested:
//
//     D(b)  = A_s(b) · G_s(b)⁻¹          the source bone's global departure
//     A_t(b) = D(b) · G_t(b)             the same departure, on the target
//     q_t(b) = A_t(parent)⁻¹ · A_t(b)    back to a local rotation
//
// where G is a rest pose accumulated down the hierarchy and A is an animated
// one. That needs the whole pose at once rather than one track at a time, so
// the clip is resampled onto a common timeline first.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE THROWN AWAY on the way through. Non-root position tracks: a
// clip carries one per joint, and each writes the SOURCE rig's bone offsets
// onto the target — overwriting the character's own bone LENGTHS sixty times a
// second with somebody else's, which is most of what "disfigured" looked like.
