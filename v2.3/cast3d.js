// THE CAST IN THREE DIMENSIONS
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A painted sprite can only face one way. Every hero on this stage has been a
// single .webp since Build 4, which is why they turn to face the camera when
// they cross the board, why a strike is a CSS nudge rather than a swing, and
// why the all-out is four sprites sliding at a fifth. The figures are the one
// part of the fight that cannot act.
//
// THIS LAYER DOES NOT REPLACE THE STAGE. That is the whole design. The DOM
// keeps every job it already does — .k-hero holds the box, the row, the drag,
// the aim target, the popups, the shadow, the drop zones, the party HUD. This
// draws ONE canvas across #k-cast, reads where the DOM has put each hero this
// frame, and paints a figure into that box. Nothing above it knows the
// difference; the img inside .k-fig is simply hidden.
//
// It follows that a CSS transform on .k-hero — the walk between rows, the
// drag, the forward lean on a play — moves the 3D figure too, for free and in
// perfect sync, because the figure's position IS the element's box read fresh
// every frame. There is no second copy of the layout to keep true.
//
// OFF BY DEFAULT. `?cast=3d` turns it on. The eight suites run the 2D stage
// exactly as before.
//
// BUILD 114: the three of them are their OWN models now, generated from the
// concept art that has been on the cards since Build 4, and they move with
// motion-captured clips instead of the eight hand-written poses that stood in
// for them. Ash keeps his sword, Elin keeps her staff. What made that
// affordable is that Meshy's humanoid auto-rig is standardised: all three came
// back with the same 24 joints, in the same order, under the same names, so
// the clip library is generated ONCE against one of them and retargets onto
// all three by name.

//
// THREE MODELS NOW, one per person, generated from the concept art that has
// been on their cards since Build 4. Build 112 ran one model in three palettes
// to find out whether the watercolour treatment could hold three separately
// generated figures together — it could, which is why this step was worth
// taking. What survives from that experiment is the palette itself.
//
// THE HUE LIVES IN THE SHADOW, NOT IN THE PAPER. Tinting the light end is how
// three figures turn into three lumps of colour — cream, sage and gold — that
// read as silhouettes rather than as painted people. Real watercolour keeps
// the paper nearly white and does its colouring where the pigment pools, so
// each hero gets a near-neutral paper and a shadow that carries the character:
// warm earth for Ash, cold slate for Elin, sage for Mira.

// ── what each verb looks like, per person ──────────────────────────────────
//
// THE FIGHT SPEAKS FOUR VERBS and has since Build 36: actionKind() returns
// heal, cast, slash or ward. Three of them are the same motion whoever throws
// them. The fourth is not — a longsword, a staff and a pair of daggers are
// three different fights — so `slash` resolves through the character's own
// `strike` and everything else is shared.
//
// The names on the right are the clips in the library, which are named for the
// VERB rather than for what Meshy called them: the game never has to know that
// a parry arrived as "Armature|Sword_Parry|baselayer".
const VERB = {

// A CLIP THAT HOLDS DOES NOT HAND THE BODY BACK. Everything else returns to
// the idle when it finishes; going down stays down until the fight says
// otherwise, which is the difference between a corpse and a stumble.
const HOLDS = { down: true };

// …and how fast each one is allowed to be. The library's clips are authored at
// a cinematic pace — a four-second sword swing is a lovely thing to look at
// and far too slow for a beat the fight resolves in a few hundred
// milliseconds. These are multipliers on playback, not edits to the data, so
// the timing can be retuned without regenerating anything.

};

// ── the animation ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// BUILD 112 WROTE THESE BY HAND. The sample model arrived with no animation —
// one 0.3s clip holding a single keyframe per channel — so its eight verbs
// were authored as bone-rotation data: readable, tiny, and unmistakably
// hand-keyed. They are gone now, and so is the STANCE correction that existed
// only because those poses were offsets from a T-pose.
//
// What replaced them is a library of ten real clips, milled out of Meshy's
// animation catalogue by v2.3/tools/clips.cjs and stored as
// THREE.AnimationClip JSON. `Combat_Stance` for the idle, `Sword_Judgment`
// for Ash, `Double_Combo_Attack` for Mira, `Attack` for Elin's staff,
// `Charged_Spell_Cast`, `mage_soell_cast` for mending, `Block1`,
// `Sword_Parry`, `Hit_Reaction`, `Knock_Down`.
//
// Ten clips arrived as ten ~6 MB GLBs, each carrying a whole character around
// the curves we actually wanted. Stripped of mesh and texture, and of the
// scale tracks a rig nothing scales does not need, the library is 685 KB.

// ── the watercolour material ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// PATCHED, NOT REPLACED. A raw ShaderMaterial has to re-implement skinning,
// and a version that silently does not renders the bind pose — which looks
// exactly like an art problem and is not one. Patching the stock material also
// keeps normals and the view vector in the SAME space (three gives both in
// view space); dotting a view-space normal against a world-space eye vector
// turns the whole figure black.
//
// Four moves, and the third is the one that actually reads as watercolour:
//   1. lift      — watercolour has no true black; the paper shows through
//   2. wash      — luminance quantised into three bands, so tone STEPS
//   3. edge dark — pigment pools where the water stops. A thin fresnel band
//                  toward ink. Without it this reads as flat 3D, not as paint.
//   4. grain     — the paper's tooth, in SCREEN space, so it stays paper and
//                  does not swim around with the figure
